# Initialisation

The init command is used to initialise a new project.

```bash copy
umi init
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |

## Examples

### Initialising a new project

```bash copy
umi init
```

### Skipping prompts

```bash copy
umi init --yes
```

## How it works

The init command uses the `init` function from the `@umi-digital/cli` package to initialise a new project. The `init` function takes in the name of the project as an argument and creates a new directory with the project's name.

The `init` function also updates the `package.json` file to include the project's name and description. This ensures that the project is properly identified when the project is installed.

The `init` function also updates the `app/layout.tsx` file to include the project's name in the page title. This ensures that the project is properly identified on the page when the project is run.
