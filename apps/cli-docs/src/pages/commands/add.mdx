## How it works

The add command uses the `add` function from the `@umi-digital/cli` package to add a new component to the project. The `add` function takes in the name of the component to add as an argument and adds the component to the project's `components` directory.

The `add` function also updates the `package.json` file to include the new component in the project's dependencies. This ensures that the component is installed when the project is installed.

The `add` function also updates the `app/layout.tsx` file to include the new component in the project's layout. This ensures that the component is rendered on the page when the project is run.
