This is the **UMI CLI** package development overview. Below there are guides for getting setup, understanding the project structure, its dependencies and how it works.

## Getting Started

To begin using the **UMI CLI**, follow these simple steps:

- Start by cloning the monorepo repository to your local machine.

<Step>
<StepItem title="Installing PNPM">

The **UMI CLI** uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager. To install PNPM, follow the instructions provided in the [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

I would recommend using brew to install PNPM on macOS:

```bash copy
brew install pnpm
```

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Cloning the Repository">

I would recommend using SSH to clone the repository. To do this, run the following command:

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:umi-labs/umi.git
```

Ensure that you have set up your SSH keys and have configured your GitHub account to use SSH. If not, follow the instructions provided in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

<Note title="SSH Keys within an Organisation" type="warning">
  As repo is within an organisation you may need to configure your SSH key to allow yourself to clone. If you have any problems please contact the [project lead](mailto:isaac@umidigital.co.uk).
</Note>

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Installing Dependencies">

```bash copy
pnpm install
```

Ensure that you have set up your SSH keys and have configured your GitHub account to use SSH. If not, follow the instructions provided in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

</StepItem>
<StepItem title="Running the Development Server">

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash copy
turbo dev
```

The monorepo uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) to manage the development environment. Turborepo is a monorepo management tool that allows you to run multiple packages in parallel, making it easier to manage and develop your project.

Whilst the CLI doesn't use a development server it is useful to run this to make sure that the project is running correctly.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:
