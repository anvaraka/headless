## CLI

Welcome to **UMI CLI**, a powerful and flexible cli package designed to simplify the process of creating high-quality, comprehensive
projects using the UHS. Built in **TypeScript** for stability with type-safety, this cli provides the foundation to build your project as well as the ability to add and remove components as easy as `umi add`.

**UMI CLI** was developed to streamline the creation, management and development of internal and external projects, allowing developers and teams to focus on the taking umi to the next level rather
than building the underlying structure. This documentation aims to help you get up and running with the cli, exploring the various features and provide
insights into how to contribute to this project effectively.
