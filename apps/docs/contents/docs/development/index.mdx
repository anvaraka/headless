## Getting Started

**UMI CLI** was developed to streamline the creation, management and development of internal and external projects, allowing developers and teams to focus on the taking umi to the next level rather
than building the underlying structure. By contributing to this package you are helping the team as a whole, however this also means that errors cause far bigger issues - to prevent this peruse these docs and
get a better idea of how we are building, collaborating, reviewing and deploying this package.
