## Intro

The init command is used to initialise a new project.

```bash copy
umi init
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--yes` | Skip prompts and use default values. | None |

## Examples

### Initialising a new project

```bash copy
umi init
```

### Skipping prompts

```bash copy
umi init --yes
```

## How it works

The init command uses the `init` command from the `@umi-digital/cli` package to initialise a new project. This command checks if there is an `umirc.json` file in the directory
and if not then creates the file. It then asks the user for values whilst providing defaults.

**It is ~strongly~ _very strongly_ suggested that you just choose these defaults.**
